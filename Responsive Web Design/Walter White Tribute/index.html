            <p>Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is the fictional protagonist of the
                American crime drama television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston.
            </p>

            <p>Walter was a skilled chemist and co-founder of a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his
                partners. While his partners became billionaires, Walter became a frustrated high-school chemistry
                teacher in Albuquerque, barely making ends meet with his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son
                Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walter is diagnosed
                with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walter resorts to manufacturing and selling
                methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to ensure his family's financial
                security after his death. Due to his expertise, Walter's "blue meth" is purer than any other on the
                market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade.
            </p>


            <p>Walter becomes increasingly ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg",
                which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walter struggles with
                managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law and DEA
                agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). Walter becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series
                creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface". Although AMC officials
                initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan
                cast him based on the actor's past performance in The X-Files episode "Drive", which Gilligan wrote.
                Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walter's backstory,
                personality, and physical appearance.
            </p>

            <p>Both the character and Cranston's performance have received critical acclaim, with Walter frequently
                being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won
                four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three of them being
                consecutive. He is the first man to win a Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen
                Actors Guild Award for his performance. Cranston reprised the role of Walt in a flashback for Breaking
                Bad's sequel film El Camino, and again in the sixth and final season of the prequel series Better Call
                Saul, making him one of the few characters to appear in all three, alongside Jesse Pinkman, Mike
                Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Ed Galbraith (Robert Forster), and Austin Ramey (Todd Terry).
